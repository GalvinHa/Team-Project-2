What was done?
- did the store-page.pug and the styles for it
- compiled images to use for the products, hotlinking images isn't reliable so I had to resort to local hosting; but if
you guys have any better idea for an alternative for this pls let us know
- started data.json for the product info
- made sure that dynamic product card for the store works

- changed the hero banner for a better one

* We can work on this simultaneously now since everything should now be separated and we can just do branches for stuff that
we are going to be specifically working on; we just let each other know

What's next?
- desktop view still needed and an aside category selection (store.pug)
- continue JSON for all of our products
- Jerome will finish favorites page and someone can work on the about page
- Jerome is checking out how the images for carousel is going to work and looking ways to better manage image sizes for the store 
and carousel feature

What was done?
I fixed the carousel so it scales down the image to fit in a square. I applied it to the fronpage as well. 
Also changed --accent-color to orange(We could change if we dont like it)
Product Page now only has options for mice.
I added the catgory section as well and it works.
Cart works can add and all totals are all working
Fixed front page to be dynamic. 
Favorites works makes a local list and pulls from json. Add and remove works
added CSS for store.pug

ToDo:
Mainly Proced to order Page
About section
If you can think of anything else please let me know.
